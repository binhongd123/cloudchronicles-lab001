Lab Objective

Demonstrate: How to failover a simple web application and its database from us-central1 to us-east1.
Showcase: Cloud SQL cross-region replica promotion.
Illustrate: Global External HTTP(S) Load Balancer automatic traffic redirection.
Utilize: Multi-Region Cloud Storage for seamless data access.
Estimated Cost

Moderate to High: Running two active regions with database replicas and load balancers will incur costs. Expect to pay at least $50-$150+ per month for the core components, even if you clean up immediately after the lab. Costs will vary based on instance sizes, traffic, and how long resources are kept running.
Important: ALWAYS set budget alerts and delete resources immediately after the lab to minimize costs.
Prerequisites

Google Cloud Project: An active Google Cloud project.
Billing Enabled: Billing must be enabled for your project.
gcloud CLI: The gcloud command-line tool installed and authenticated.
Permissions: You need Project Owner or IAM roles with permissions to create Compute Engine instances, Cloud SQL instances, Cloud Storage buckets, and Load Balancers.
Lab Steps

We'll break this down into setup, simulation, and cleanup.

Part 1: Lab Setup (Primary Region: us-central1, Secondary: us-east1)

This involves setting up your infrastructure in both regions.

1. Enable Necessary APIs

Open Cloud Shell or your local terminal and run:
